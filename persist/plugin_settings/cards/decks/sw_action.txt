#The Rules! Shuffle the Adventure Deck at the start of each game session. Deal one card to each player for each of his character's Ranks (e.g. two for Seasoned, five for Legendary).
#Cards which give you an additional draw give you an additional play of your remaining cards as well.
#Players may trade cards at any time, but may not just *give* them away. Players can use these cards at any time as spelled out on the individual cards.
#Discard unused cards after each game session.
#New Edge! Add the following Background Edge if you use the Adventure Deck. If additing it to an existing game, we suggest you allow players the opportunity to select Destiny's Child on the their next Advance and limit it as normal afterwards.
#Destiny's Child: Requirements: Novice
